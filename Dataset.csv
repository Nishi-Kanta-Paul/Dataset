This is the one time of year that | love wasps.

Not because the wasps themselves get any nicer: They're horrid ite
Creatures year round. No, i's because Ihave @ couple of big apple trees
out back, and late August, early September is when the apples start
ripening

Now; if you don't harvest your own fruit there are two things you need to
know about apples.

‘The first thing you need to knaw about apples is that, when appies get
nips, they tend to fall from the tree at the slightest breeze.

Foften work fate at the office; by the time | get home, there are piles of
apples scattered everywhere - and sure enough, the wasps are out in
force. gorging themselves on the frutt. When 1 go to clean up the winatalien
apples. the wasps naturally do the “raw, fma hick you up” routine for
which wasps are known.

‘The second thing you need to know about apples is that they ferment
Very rapidly in the late August heat

So’ the wasps try to come at me, but they're too drunk to fly. They get
about an inch off the ground, then facepiant directty into the turf, fip over
‘onto their backs, and lay there, legs twitching in the air as they try in vain
to find something to sting,

Perhaps (ma man of simple pleasures, but | bust up laughing every.
single. time:

Fucking wasps.

Just a reminder:the natural diet of these birds is BONES.
Not just bone marrow; actual bone shards. They pick up
huge freaking bones from carcasses and drop them
onto rocks until they get spiky pieces and then they
swallow them. Their stomach acid dissolves bone

look me in the eye and tell me that's not a fucking dragon

And they aren't naturally red like that. That's self-applied
makeup. They find the reddest earth they can to work into their
feathers as a status symbol

And they don't scavenge other parts of carcases, just the bones.
85-90% of their diet is exclusively bone. Hence why it's only a
myth that these birds would just pick up whole lambs and carry
them off. It's not true, but in German they're still called
Lammergeier as a result

So metal

no that is a fucking dragon

Many physical effects of stress are the same as
those of exhilaration (e.g. heavy breathing,
speeding heart, etc.). If you reframe your
threatening situation as a challenging one, your
stress will become exhilaration.

to agree to a smaller favor if they deny a larger

If you make yourself be really happy and
excited to see other people, the next time they

more excited about it. (Dogs do this trick to us
all the time.)

Emotional expressions are one way to cause

assume the original answer wasn't good
enough, and they'll keep talking.

they'll probably get angrier, but they'll be

Chew gum or eat food if you're doing something

Girls who masturbate. The clitoris is not meant for self
pleasure. It's meant for creating a child, you morons.
Do you know why you feel like garbage after you
masturbate? That's because your clitoris is sending
bad chemicals to your brain. By touching yourself, you
are killing your body.

GUYS I FIGURED IT OUT
Okay so you know how in Beauty in the Beast..
I need six eggs! -That's too expensive!
This lady can't afford six eggs, which always struck me as a attic odd but figured maybe that was normal in a poor French village I mean, look at all the little kids she has she protiatily struggles to afford any kind of food that would feed all of them... Right?
But later we discover something interesting about Gaston
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs so I'm roughly the size of a barge
Gaston eats five dozen eggs every day That's 60 eggs, SIXTY Which adds up to 420 eggs per week. No wonder this poor village doesn't have enough of them to go around
Gaston, who is very well-respected and successful and probably makes good money from his fabulous hunting skills, is cornering the entire egg market. To feed his addiction, he probably has to constantly go around and buy out every farmer's supply of eggs, which causes the price on any remaining eggs to skyrocket
Gaston is singlehandedly destroying the lown's economy
Way to go, Gaston. Yeu may be popular bus t'm sure that at least the chicken farmers were relieved when you tell to your death

Sausage-addicted kookaburra too fat to fly

Story summary:
+ Bird became fat on BBQ handouts
+ Too fat to escape mauling by dogs
+ She weighed a whopping 540g

TOO many tasty sausages almost killed
this kookaburra.

But health worries weren't the threat. She
became so obese from barbecue handouts
she could not fly when attacked by dogs
in a Mosman park.

After weighing in at 540g, 40 per cent
heavier than a typical adult bird, the
kookaburra has been sent to bird boot
camp to shed weight, prompting Taronga
Zoo to warn we are killing our wildlife
with kindness,

Did you know that you actually can
never forget a face? Every single
face you’ve ever seen during your
life gets stored into your memories,
and gets used up later. For
example, in dreams your brain can’t
just make up a face. Every single
face you’ve seen in your dream,
you’ve seen somewhere once in
your life.

And those strange nightmares
you’ve had of those terrible demon
like creatures ?

You've seen them around too, you
just cant remember. You don’t want
to remember.

novel and ended as a Stephen King.

She was startled and said that oh, she must have just
heard a possum outside her window.

Me: “OH GOD CLOSE YOUR WINDOW RIGHT NOW D:

After an amusingly long circular conversation where she
‘thought | was irrationally scared of the adorable little
animal on the left, we figured out that we were
discussing two very different animals. She sent me a
picture, | awwed. Then | sent her a picture

""WHAT IS THAT THING?!""

The last time | saw one that wasn't roadkill, it was hissing at
me from the shadows of a dark driveway | was walking past
and | just bolted for a good hundred feet or so out of reflex.
